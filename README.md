# how to make lines!
1. download the code
2. make a function that takes a variable, for the x axis
3.  must return the value for the y axis
4. go to sketch.js
5. in the function fill operation add two things:
  
1. the operation array must have the string "simple"
2. the calculate array must have the name of your function WITHOUT ()
  
# circkles or other complex lines
these have precisly 2 or 0 y values per x value
1. in the function you must now have 2 calculatins and 1 variable
2. this variable is a boolian that switches between the 2 results for the y axis 
  
# tips:
1. it is a good idea to make a local variable when x is used but it is not required
2. you can use functions from refractions to do recursive math operations, but a lot of them are available with Math.
